Data list:
- Unfolded surfaces of as-built specimens: TIF images, height values and spatial scale in µm.
- Unfolded surfaces of electropolished specimens: TIF images, values and spatial scale in µm. Registered with the as-built unfolded images. Not presented in the paper due to lack of space.
- Height map and laser image of micro-sized holes caused by particles tearing at electropolishing (laser scanning confocal microscopy).
- Segmented 3D images of as-built specimens.
